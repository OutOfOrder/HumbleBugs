Coding and Style Guide
======================

HumbleBugs is a rails 3.2 application using Compass and Blueprint SASS mixings for style sheets. Ideally every feature
should have rspec specs written to ensure it functions and continues to function as expected.  Minimally the requires
tests are the controller tests, and the "role" tests.
